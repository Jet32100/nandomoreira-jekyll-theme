The key to thinking like a programmer is major patience. It can take days just to find the small things that are stopping your programming from running. You won’t be able to be a good coder if you are not totally focused and moving smoothly through your code. However, if you do come to a hiccup and aren’t able to figure it out, continue to power through until you do. You don’t want to come back the next day and forget what you were working on. Lots of coding is dealing with the awful experience of trying to figure something out when you have no idea where to start, but thankfully when you do figure it out it is all worth it. An important thing to know about coding is there is no right or wrong way to code something, it is about figuring out the best way to do it for what you are doing, which is part of what makes it so enjoyable. Another important aspect of thinking like a programmer is figuring out how to use your programming language in ways that haven’t been done before, and creating new things using the tool set that the language gives you. However, on the other end of the spectrum, it is important as a programmer to think like a computer. What I mean by that is it is important to think and write your code in a way that is ideal for a computer to read as fast as possible, and to be easiest to run. It should be the programmer’s goal to always try and make their code as short and simple as possible, in order to preserve the computers processing ability for more code later on. Overall, the keys to thinking like a programmer include remaining focused, patient, resilient, and thinking like a computer.
