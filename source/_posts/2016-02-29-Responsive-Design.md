Responsive design is the idea of creating a website that gives user the best and easiest possible experience, regardless of the device they are using. Responsive design is becoming increasingly more important as adapting for new devices has become more important as mobile now encompasses more than half of the internet. The first website with support for responsive web design, allowing for the site to adapt to multiple devices was creating by Audi in 2001, which created lots of controversy because Internet Explorer was able to support it, but Netscape wasn’t. In responsive design, elements of the web page readjust based on proportions, instead of static lengths/widths. Something that is a three column web page on desktop could be a two column page on a iPad and single page on an iPhone. Responsive design uses a grid system in order to rearrange elements. Since responsive design depends on rearranging components around the page, developers need to work firmly together to guarantee a usable web experience across all devices. Using responsive design can be very tedious, as it revolves around reconfiguring elements of a page to fit all resolutions, regardless of dimension constraints. For responsive design to be completely successful, all the elements shown on one page must fit on another device. Responsive Web Designs offers huge advantages over developing individual sites for different devices. Using the same code for all devices, instead of individually coding many different sites, makes site updating much easier as you only have to change the code for one site. Although responsive design is a very useful tool, it is not a guarantee to work. Although using Responsive Design will make life easier across multiple devices, it does not insure that is will always work on all devices. Development teams must continue testing on all new devices, in order to make sure their code isn’t breaking.
