Inline vs Inline Block vs Block, and how they are used in Cascading Style Sheets.


Inside a program, Inline is the code that makes the styling of everything look how you want it to. Inline is used between Hypertext Markup Language and Cascading Style Sheets to communicate where things need to be. With just a few lines of code, HTML can be easily placed wherever you want it to be on your web page. Inline code is normally used to move blocks throughout your code, as opposed to moving individual elements throughout it. Inline Block allows anyone to create a grid of boxes that fills browser width and height easily.. This has been possible for a long time, but revolved around people using float, but now with inline-block it has become much easier. Inline-Block elements are similar to Inline elements, expect they allow you to set a width and height. You can achieve the same effect of using floats using Inline Block, with simpler code. In Cascading Style Sheets, Block is essentially a group of code that is in a container known as a “block”. Blocks are made up of multiple Hypertext Markup Language elements, which means anything that begins with a tag. The creation of the idea of the block came from some of the first coders in the late 1950’s, who saw the need for a way to organize their code. The start and end of a block can be determined by where the first tag of the block is, and the block ends where the word end is. Blocks are an essential part of all Cascading Style Sheets. Overall, Inline Block, Inline, and Block are all essential parts of the design and styling of your code.
