When you start solving larger problems organization is key. You don't want 100 different methods and variables that do overlapping things. If you're trying to keep track of data, you want to do so in the most organized way possible so you can recycle methods and only need to update that data in one place at a time. Classes are in ruby to make your life easier. Classes share their methods, but not necessarily variables. You don't want all of your video game characters to have the same traits, so we use instance variables allow you to change their different attributes on a per-character basis. The formatting of a class is generally pretty simple, the title of the class always has to start with a capital letter. Any object-oriented program involves classes and objects. Classes the blueprint from which individual objects are created. In object-oriented terms, we say that your bicycle is an instance of the class of objects known as bicycles. Take the example of any vehicle. It has wheels, horsepower, and fuel or gas tank size. These characteristics form the data members of the class Vehicle. You can differentiate one vehicle from the other with the help of these characteristics. A vehicle can also have certain functions, such as halting, driving, and speeding. Even these functions form the data members of the class Vehicle. You can, therefore, define a class as a combination of characteristics and functions. By assigning different values to these data members, you can form several instances of the class Vehicle. For example, an airplane has three wheels, horsepower of 1,000, fuel as the type of tank, and a capacity of 100 gallons. In the same way, a car has four wheels, horsepower of 200, gas as the type of tank, and a capacity of 25 gallons.
